#  Mississippi Allows Mobile Sports Gambling

Mississippi has legalized mobile sports gambling, becoming the latest state to do so as the industry continues to grow in popularity. The new law went into effect on Friday and will allow people within the state to place bets on sporting events using their smartphones.

"This is a great day for the people of Mississippi and a great day for those who enjoy sports betting," Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement. "I am proud that our state has taken this step to enable more legal options for those who like to bet on games."

Bryant, who signed the bill into law last month, said that it would create jobs and generate additional tax revenue for the state. The move comes as a growing number of states are moving to legalize mobile sports gambling, which is seen as a way to bring in additional revenue without having to impose new taxes.

Mississippi joins a number of other states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, that have recently legalized mobile sports betting. In New Jersey, which launched its mobile betting app in May, more than $16 million was wagered in the first two weeks alone.

Industry analysts expect that mobile sports betting will continue to grow in popularity, with revenues reaching $4.8 billion by 2023. That's up from $2.6 billion this year.

#  Delaware and New Jersey Join States Allowing Mobile Sports Gambling

A recent ruling by the US Supreme Court overturned a law that had banned gambling on sports nationwide. This has led to many states legalizing and regulating mobile sports gambling in the past few weeks. Delaware and New Jersey are the latest states to join in, each with its own system in place.

In Delaware, betting is available through the state's casinos and horse racing tracks. There is a minimum bet of $2,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and players can bet on individual games or choose parlays (multiple games) or teasers (a set of two or more games in which the point spread is manipulated to give the player a better chance of winning). Bettors must be at least 21 years old.

New Jersey's new system is more like that of Nevada, with a variety of options available for gamblers. Bets can be placed at race tracks, casinos, and online through authorized gaming sites. There is no minimum age requirement, but players must be located within state lines to place bets.

Both states are seeing brisk business so far, with Delaware taking in $380,000 on its first day of operation and New Jersey bringing in over $3 million in its first week alone. There is expected to be even more money wagered as the World Cup heats up this summer.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized mobile sports gambling, but it's likely that more will follow as the revenue potential becomes clearer. For now, though, those living in Delaware or New Jersey can enjoy placing bets on their favorite teams without having to go too far out of their way.

#  Nevada Allows Mobile Sports Betting

The state of Nevada has always been a gambling mecca in the United States. With Las Vegas as its largest city, it was only natural that the state would take advantage of new gambling technologies as they became available. In fact, Nevada was one of the first states to legalize mobile sports betting.

Mobile sports betting is when people can place bets on sporting events using their smartphones or other mobile devices. This type of betting has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people have begun using smartphones. In fact, some experts believe that mobile sports betting will eventually eclipse traditional sports betting.

Nevada has been at the forefront of this trend, and the state's casinos have taken full advantage of mobile sports betting. There are now several casinos in Las Vegas that offer mobile sports betting services, and these casinos are seeing a lot of business from gamblers who want to bet on their favorite teams and athletes.

The popularity of mobile sports betting is not just limited to Nevada though. In fact, several other states have also legalized this type of gambling. This includes Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. More states are likely to legalize mobile sports betting in the near future, as the popularity of this form of gambling continues to grow.

#  Pennsylvania Considering Allowing Mobile Sports Betting

On Thursday, May 31, 2018, Pennsylvania's House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize mobile sports betting in the state. The vote was 104-91.

The next step for the bill is for it to be passed by the Senate and then signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf. If it does become law, Pennsylvania would join Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia in allowing mobile sports betting.

The bill's sponsor, Representative Martin Causer (R), said that the aim of the bill is to bring more revenue to the state. "This is a way to help balance our budget without putting an additional burden on taxpayers," he said.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems. Representative Nick Miccarelli (R) said, "I'm not one who generally opposes gaming expansion; however, I have real concerns about this particular proposal."

One thing that is not clear yet is whether or not the casinos in Pennsylvania will have exclusivity over mobile sports betting or if it will be open to other entities such as daily fantasy sports companies like FanDuel and DraftKings.

#  Rhode Island Could be Next State to Legalize Mobile Sports Gambling

The Rhode Island legislature is considering a bill that would legalize mobile sports gambling in the state.

If the bill is passed, Rhode Islanders could place bets on sporting events using their phones or other mobile devices. The legislation would allow betting through licensed sportsbooks, as well as through app-based operators.

The move follows the legalization of mobile sports gambling in New Jersey last year. That state saw more than $385 million in wagers in the first half of 2018 alone.

Rhode Island officials are hopeful that legalizing mobile sports gambling will help to boost tourism and tax revenue in the state. They believe that it could also create jobs in the gaming industry.

Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. They also argue that it would be difficult to regulate such a system.
