#  Get the most out of your Queen of Queens game experience!

The Queen of Queens board game by Gamewright is a strategic game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up. The goal of the game is to collect as many sets of five coins as possible and then be the first player to reach the finish space.

Although the game can be enjoyed without any strategy, there are a few things you can do to get the most out of your Queen of Queens game experience:

1. Pay attention to your opponents’ moves.

If you are able to, pay attention to what your opponents are doing so that you can block them from getting coins or sets. For example, if you see that an opponent is trying to get a set of four coins, you can try to get in their way so they can’t finish the set.

2. Try not to get blocked yourself.

In the same vein, try not to get blocked yourself so that you can keep moving along the board and collecting coins. If you find yourself blocked, see if there’s any way you can free yourself up so you can continue playing.

3. Use your cards wisely.

There are six cards in the deck: two dodge cards, two speed cards, and two switch cards. Keep these in mind when playing, as they can help you move along the board more quickly or block your opponents from getting ahead. For example, if an opponent is one space away from getting a coin, use a speed card to quickly move ahead of them and claim the coin for yourself!

4. Plan ahead.

One of the best things about Queen of Queens is that it’s a turn-based game – this means that players take turns moving their pieces instead of all players moving at once. This gives players time to think about their next move and plan ahead accordingly. For example, if you know an opponent is close to getting a set of five coins, save your switch card until they’re just one space away so that you can block them from finishing the set.
