#  What is the Super Sevens game?

The Super Sevens game is a casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to make as many seven-point hands as possible. A seven-point hand consists of seven cards of any rank, either all different or all the same, except for wild cards which can be any rank.

The game begins by dealing each player seven cards face down. The player to the dealer's left starts the betting round, and must either bet an amount equal to the ante or fold. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with each player either betting or folding in turn. After the first betting round, the dealer flips over the next card in the deck, called the turn card. This card is also turned over to form a new row on the table, known as the flop.

In order to bet, a player must have at least two cards of the same rank. If a player has two cards of the same rank, they can either bet double their original bet or "go set" which means they place an equal bet on both bets and their opponent matches it. If a player does not have two cards of the same rank, they can still bet but only for the amount of their ante.

After all players have had a chance to bet, another card is flipped over from the deck, called the river card. This card is placed at the end of the flop row on the table. Now players reveals their cards and winners are paid out according to standard poker rankings. The highest ranking hand wins automatically and there is no showdown if there is only one winner. In cases where there are multiple winners, ties are broken by suit starting with clubs (highest), hearts (second highest), diamonds (third highest), and Spades (lowest).
