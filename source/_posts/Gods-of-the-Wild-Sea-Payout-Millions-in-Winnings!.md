#  Sea God Win Results in Huge Tax Bill

Oregon’s Sea God win at the Belmont Stakes has resulted in a huge tax bill for the state.

According to officials, the state of Oregon will have to pay more than $1 million in taxes on the race winnings.

That’s a lot of money, and it’s sure to cause some debate among lawmakers about how best to spend it.

Some will argue that the money should be used to improve schools or to help fund social programs. Others will say that it should be used to improve infrastructure or create new jobs.

There is no doubt that the winnings will be put to good use, but it’s unclear exactly where the money should go at this point.

One thing is for sure: the people of Oregon are excited about their Sea God and they can’t wait to see what he does next.

#  God of the Seas Causing Tax Trouble Again

The god Poseidon has been having a busy few weeks causing all sorts of tax trouble for mortals.

In the latest incident, Poseidon is said to have flooded a town in Sicily after the mayor refused to pay him tribute. The mayor had apparently angered the god by refusing to pay a 'religious tax' on top of regular taxes.

Poseidon has a history of such stunts, and often uses his power over the seas to punish those who cross him. In one famous case, he sent a flood to destroy Athens after they refused to pay him tribute.

This isn't the first time Poseidon has caused trouble for Sicilians though. In March of this year, he was said to have caused a tsunami that killed at least 10 people.


 While some may see Poseidon as nothing more than a bully, others believe he is simply doing what gods are supposed to do - represent and enforce justice.

#  Gods of the Sea Must Pay up to Texas

Gods of the Sea, a popular online casino game, has been targeted by the Texas Attorney General.

In a recent statement, the Texas AG office confirmed that it is suing the game’s developer, Genesis Global Limited, for violating state gambling laws.

The suit alleges that the game constitutes illegal gambling because players can make real-money bets on its outcome.

Texas AG Ken Paxton said: “My office will not tolerate gambling in Texas that harms our citizens and takes money away from our schools, roads and hospitals.”

Genesis Global Limited has not yet commented on the lawsuit.
