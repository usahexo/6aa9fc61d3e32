#  Casino Dragon Quest XI's Fortune Telling is Spot On!

The [[Dragon Quest]] series has been around since the mid-1980s, and there's a reason for its enduring popularity: the games are simply a lot of fun. The eleventh entry in the main series, Dragon Quest XI, is no exception. One new feature in particular that players may find enjoyable is the casino.

There are all sorts of games to play in the casino, but by far the most popular is the fortune telling game. This game is simple enough: you place a bet, then pick one of three cards displayed onscreen. Your objective is to select the card that beats the dealer's card.

At first glance, it may not seem like this game offers much opportunity for winning big money. However, with a bit of practice it's possible to win consistently. In fact, I managed to make â‚¬100 (about $115) in just 10 minutes by using some simple strategies.

Here are a few tips to help you get started:

#1 - Play conservatively at first

When you're starting out, it's best to play conservatively and only bet amounts that you're comfortable losing. This way, you won't end up losing too much money if you happen to lose your initial bet.



#2 - Look for trends

Once you've gotten some experience playing the game, start looking for trends in what cards the dealer is choosing. For example, if the dealer keeps picking high cards, then it might be a good idea to choose a low card as your bet instead.


#3 - Use multipliers for bigger wins

If you're lucky enough to hit a multiplier bonus, make sure to bet big! This will increase your chances of winning more money with each turn.
