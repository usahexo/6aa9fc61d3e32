#  NJ Sports Betting Bonanza: State Officials Say Legalization Will Bring in $1 Billion Annually

Governor Phil Murphy is banking on legalized sports betting to bring in $1 billion in annual revenue for New Jersey, and state officials say the new law is already paying off.

Since New Jersey's new sports betting law went into effect on June 14, the state has taken in more than $16 million in bets. That's more than twice the amount taken in during the same period last year, before the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

Most of that revenue has come from online betting, which accounted for more than $11 million of the total. That's a good sign for Governor Murphy, who has said that online gambling will be a key source of revenue for the state.

Legalized sports betting is also creating jobs in New Jersey. Last month, the Monmouth Park racetrack hired 300 people to work in its new sportsbook, and it plans to hire even more as demand continues to grow.

New Jersey is not the only state benefiting from legalized sports betting. Since the Supreme Court ruling, at least eight other states have moved to legalize sports betting, and more are expected to follow suit.

Governor Murphy says that legalized sports betting will help create a "new economic engine" for New Jersey, and he's already seeing evidence that this is true. The latest numbers show that New Jersey is on track to rake in $1 billion in annual revenue from sports betting, and that number is only going to grow as more states legalize it.

#  NJ Poised to Cash in on Sports Betting as Bill Passes Legislature 

New Jersey passed a sports betting bill on Monday, and the state is now poised to cash in on what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar industry.

The legislation, which was passed by a vote of 29-5 in the Senate and 74-0 in the Assembly, authorizes sports betting at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey. Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law.

"Today, we are finally giving the people of New Jersey what they have asked for: legalized sports betting," said State Senator Raymond Lesniak, one of the bill's sponsors. "This will be a major boost to our casino and racetrack industries, and will bring much-needed revenue to our state."

The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law last month that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. That decision paved the way for New Jersey and other states to move forward with plans to offer sports betting.

At least eight states are now expected to offer sports betting this year, including New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Nevada and Louisiana. The market could be worth as much as $15 billion annually, according to some estimates.

"The floodgates are open now," said Dustin Gouker, senior analyst at Legal Sports Report. "We are going to see a lot of action in the next few months as states race to get things up and running."

Casinos and racetracks in New Jersey stand to benefit from the new law. Monmouth Park Racetrack has already announced plans to start taking bets on Thursday morning. And both Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and Caesars Entertainment have expressed interest in getting into the business.

There are also expectations that online sports books will flourish under the new law. FanDuel, one of the largest online fantasy sports companies, has already announced plans to introduce a new product called "FanDuel Sportsbook" that will allow customers to bet on sporting events using their phones or computers.

#  NJ Set to Open Up Sports Betting and Other Gambling Operations 

# The state of New Jersey is getting ready to open up sports betting and other gambling operations in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn a federal ban on such activities.

# The high court ruled that the 1992 law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional, clearing the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting.

# Governor Phil Murphy, who campaigned on legalizing sports betting, said he planned to sign an executive order authorizing such activity “immediately.”

# Murphy also said he hoped the legislature would pass a bill authorizing sports betting by early June.

# New Jersey has been battling the federal government over sports betting for years, with the state supreme court twice ruling in favor of allowing such activities.

# But PASPA, which barred all states but Nevada from legalizing gambling operations, had prevented New Jersey from implementing those decisions.

# The US Supreme Court’s decision not only allows New Jersey to move forward with plans to authorize and regulate sports betting, but could pave the way for other states to do so as well.

# In its 5-4 decision, the high court struck down PASPA as a violation of states’ rights under the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution.

#  Finally, NJ Residents Can Place Bets on Their Favorite Sports Teams

### The wait is over, sports fans in New Jersey can finally place legal bets on their favorite teams. Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law on Monday that allows for sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.

The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law last month that barred most states from legalizing sports betting.

“This is a great day for the people of New Jersey,” Murphy said at a news conference on Monday. “They have waited long enough.”

Murphy added that the new law would help to create jobs and generate additional tax revenue for the state.

Casinos and racetracks in NJ had been pushing for legalization of sports betting for years, arguing that it would generate much-needed revenue for the struggling gaming industry. But the idea has faced resistance from some lawmakers and officials in other states, who argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills.

Under the new law in NJ, bettors will be able to make bets on professional and college sports, as well as other events such as horse races and golf tournaments. Sports leagues including the NBA and MLB have been seeking a share of the revenue from sports betting, and Murphy said on Monday that he was open to talks with them.

So far, only a few casinos in NJ have received approval from regulators to offer sports betting. Monmouth Park Racetrack plans to start taking bets on Thursday, while Borgata Casino plans to offer them within weeks.

#  With Sports Betting Approved, NJ Poised for Huge Revenue Boost

Sports betting is now legal in New Jersey after the US Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had banned sports gambling.

The Christie administration projected that sports betting would bring in $1.3 billion in annual revenue, and experts believe that number could be much higher.

Some lawmakers are pushing for the state to take an even bigger cut of the profits, pointing to Nevada, which takes a 10% tax on gambling winnings.

“I think we should have a higher tax rate than 10%,” said State Assemblyman Ralph Caputo (D-Essex). “We are the Garden State. We should get more out of this than Nevada does.”

Governor Phil Murphy has not yet announced his plans for taxation, but he is expected to include a percentage in his upcoming budget proposal.

 whatever amount Governor Phil Murphy proposes as the percentage from taxing casinos’ revenues from betting on sporting events will add millions more dollars to help fund NJ’s budget. That number is still being debated, with some lawmakers believing that NJ should aim to get closer to the 25% take that Pennsylvania charges on casino gaming revenue. Another consideration is whether or not mobile apps and websites that offer sports betting will be based in NJ; if they are not, then there may be a lower tax rate required so these businesses will choose to set up here rather than overseas.
