#  Delaware legalizes sports betting, except for Delaware casinos

May 14, 2018

The state of Delaware has legalized sports betting, except for casinos in the state. The law was signed by Governor John Carney on Monday.

It is now legal for residents 21 years or older to bet on sports at the state's three racetracks - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway and Dover Downs - as well as its lottery sales agent locations. Online sports betting will also be available via the state's lottery website.

However, casino gambling is still prohibited in Delaware, with the exception of casinos in the city of Wilmington. This means that people cannot place bets on sports at casinos such as Caesar's Atlantic City or Harrah's Philadelphia.

"This legislation will maintain Delaware's dominance as the leading Mid-Atlantic gaming destination while protecting our casino industry," said Carney in a statement.

Reuters reports that the move could bring in an extra $9 million annually in revenue to Delaware, which is facing a budget shortfall of $400 million. Sports betting brought in $3 million in 2017 across Nevada, New Jersey and West Virginia, according to research company Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC.



Delaware becomes the 6th state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in May 2018. In addition to Delaware, that includes Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and West Virginia. Rhode Island also plans to legalize it soon.

#  NJ Sports Betting losing $4M a month; state is looking to Woori Casino

The state of New Jersey is looking for a new partner to help it turn around its struggling sports betting industry. NJ has been hemorrhaging money since it launched sports betting in 2018, currently losing around $4 million per month.

State officials are now looking to Woori Casino as a possible savior. Woori is a South Korean company that already has a presence in the U.S. market, and officials believe that they could help jumpstart NJ's sports betting industry.

Woori is expected to make a decision in the coming months, and if they decide to move forward, it could mean big things for NJ's economy. Officials estimate that Woori could bring in upwards of $1 billion in revenue over the next five years, which would be a major boon for the state.

In order to lure Woori into partnering with them, NJ has offered up some pretty lucrative incentives. They've promised to give Woori a 50% share of all profits generated by sports betting, as well as a cut of all online poker and casino revenues. In addition, they will also allow Woori to operate its own physical casinos in the state.

NJ Sports Betting is Struggling

Despite being one of the first states to legalize sports betting, NJ's sports betting industry is struggling. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including heavy taxes and regulatory costs, as well as competition from neighbouring states.



In 2018, just after NJ legalized sports betting, the state took in $16 million in revenue from the activity. However, by 2019 that number had dwindled down to just $11 million. This trend is likely to continue unless something is done to revive the industry.


Woori Could Help Revive NJ's Sports Betting Industry

That's where Woori comes in. The South Korean company has experience operating in the U.S. market, and officials believe that they could help jumpstart NJ's sports betting industry. In fact, they're so confident in Woori's ability that they're offering them some very lucrative incentives if they agree to partner with them.


NJ has promised to give Woori a 50% share of all profits generated by sports betting, as well as a cut of all online poker and casino revenues. They've also agreed to let Woori operate its own physical casinos in the state. These incentives are likely enough to convince Woori to move forward with the deal.

#  Atlantic City casino complex could be one of the first in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting

_If a measure legalizing sports betting in Pennsylvania is signed into law, the Borgata casino in Atlantic City could be one of the first facilities in the state to offer the new form of gambling._

Last week, lawmakers in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Under the proposed measure, casinos and racetracks would be able to offer sports betting. The Pennsylvania Lottery would also be authorized to offer online sports betting.

The Borgata casino in Atlantic City is one of several casinos in New Jersey that have been authorized to offer sports betting since last year, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting.

Earlier this year, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board issued permits to five casinos and two racetracks to offer sports betting if the state legalizes the activity. The Borgata was among those awarded a permit.

If the Pennsylvania Senate approves the bill and it is signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf, the Borgata could begin offering sports betting as early as this summer.

#  Rhode Island lawmakers want sports betting, minus the Woori Casino

Rhode Island state lawmakers say they want to offer sports betting, but they don’t want the Woori Casino in the mix. The state Senate president, Dominick Ruggerio, said this week that he’s been in touch with representatives of the major professional sports leagues, as well as the NCAA, about his plans to legalize and regulate sports betting next year.

Ruggerio told reporters on Tuesday that he doesn’t want Rhode Island’s only casino – the Woori casino in Lincoln – to get a monopoly on sports betting. He wants other casinos and racetracks in the state to be able to offer it as well.

The news comes as a bit of a surprise, since Ruggerio was part of the team that helped pass a law last year authorizing the Woori casino. The new law allows resorts in Rhode Island with at least 500 hotel rooms to apply for a casino license. The Woori casino has 600 rooms.

Ruggerio now says he wants to repeal that law and replace it with one that would authorize sports betting at all of Rhode Island’s casinos and racetracks. He says he also wants to give the state lottery a piece of the action, so it can fund education programs.

Lawmakers in some other states are also looking into legalizing sports betting. But they’re facing opposition from professional sports leagues, which are concerned about game-fixing and other forms of cheating.

#  West Virginia legislature passes bill to allow sports betting, but excludes the Woori Casino

The West Virginia legislature has passed a bill to allow sports betting, but the Woori Casino is not included in the legislation.

The Woori Casino is the only casino in the state of West Virginia, and it is located in the capital city of Charleston. The casino is owned by the Korean American Association of West Virginia.

Supporters of the casino say that it is unfair that the casino is not included in the bill. They argue that the casino should be able to offer sports betting just like other casinos in the state.

Opponents of the casino argue that it should not be allowed to offer sports betting because it is not a traditional casino. They argue that the casino should be limited to its current offerings, which include table games and slot machines.

The Woori Casino has already been approved by the state lottery commission to offer sports betting, but it will not be able to do so until the legislature passes a bill specifically authorizing it to do so.
