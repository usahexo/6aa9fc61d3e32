#  NJ Online Casino Launches - First of its Kind in the US!

The wait is finally over for New Jersey residents who have been eagerly anticipating the launch of the state’s first online casino! On November 26th, 2013, the doors opened to players all over the Garden State.

Powered by Borgata Casino, which is a joint venture between Boyd Gaming and MGM Resorts International, the new site offers both its own proprietary games as well as software from some of the world’s top casino game providers.

What sets this casino apart from those in other states is that it is the only one that offers full-scale online gaming, including casino games, poker and sports betting. This means that players can enjoy everything from blackjack and roulette to Texas Hold’em and football betting without having to leave their homes.

There are currently three online casinos operating in New Jersey - BorgataCasino.com, PartyCasino.com and GoldenNuggetCasino.com - with more set to open in 2014. The list of approved online casinos will be announced by the end of January 2014 and will include CaesarsCasino.com, TropicanaCasino.com, VirginCasino.com and BetfairCasino.com.

The approval process for these casinos was no easy feat; it took many months of negotiations between state regulators and casino operators to hammer out all of the details needed for a successful launch. In order to be approved, each casino had to agree to stringent regulations, including limits on how much money players could lose in any given day or week as well as rules prohibiting problem gambling behavior.

One thing that has already become clear is that the regulated NJ online casinos are outperforming their illegal counterparts. Since November 26th, when Borgata Casino became operational, its website has generated over $4 million in revenue from almost 70,000 registrations - not too shabby for a site that has only been live for two weeks!

So what are you waiting for? If you live in New Jersey, head on over to Borgata Casino and get started on your online gaming journey today!
