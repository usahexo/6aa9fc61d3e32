#  Pelicans soar to new heights with latest victory!

The New Orleans Pelicans continued their winning ways with a 111-104 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night. Led by Anthony Davis' 36 points and 13 rebounds, the Pelicans were able to outpace the Sixers in the second half and pick up their fourth win in their last five games.

The game was tight throughout, with six lead changes and nine ties. The Pelicans pulled away in the fourth quarter, thanks in part to 28 combined points from Davis and Jrue Holiday.

"We just stuck together," said Davis after the game. "They made a run, but we just kept playing our game."

With the victory, the Pelicans (27-25) move into sixth place in the Western Conference playoff race. They now trail the Portland Trail Blazers by just one game for the fifth seed.

"It's great to be in this position right now," said Holiday. "We're just trying to take it one game at a time."

Next up for the Pelicans is a home game against Kemba Walker and the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday night.

#  Pelicans keep their strong start going with another big win!

The Pelicans continued their hot start to the season with another big win, this time over the Rockets. It was a close game for most of the night, but New Orleans pulled away in the fourth quarter to win 112-106.

Anthony Davis led the way for the Pelicans with 34 points and 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday also had a big night, finishing with 27 points and 10 assists.

Houston was led by James Harden, who had 37 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists. Chris Paul added 26 points and seven assists for the Rockets.

The Pelicans are now 5-1 on the season and continue to look like one of the top teams in the NBA. They will next face the Bulls on Wednesday night.

#  Pelicans continue to impress, add another victory to their record!

The New Orleans Pelicans continue to impress as they added another victory to their record, now standing at 15-13. This latest victory came against the highly touted Oklahoma City Thunder, with Anthony Davis leading the way yet again.

Davis was absolutely dominant in this game, putting up 41 points and grabbing 18 rebounds. Jrue Holiday also played a big role for the Pelicans, scoring 21 points and dishing out 10 assists.

This was a very close game throughout, with the Pelicans leading for most of the fourth quarter. However, the Thunder made a late push to try and come back, but ultimately fell short.

This was an impressive victory for the Pelicans and continues their hot streak heading into the new year. They will need to continue to play this well if they want to make a run at the playoffs in a tough Western Conference.

#  Pelicans maintain undefeated streak with another win!

The New Orleans Pelicans managed to stay undefeated by beating the Utah Jazz on the road. The final score was 116-108, with Anthony Davis leading the way for the Pelicans with 34 points and 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday added 21 points, while Nikola Mirotic scored 20 off the bench.

The Jazz led for most of the game but were unable to keep up with Davis and Company in the fourth quarter. Rudy Gobert led Utah with 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Donovan Mitchell scored 18 points.

This was an impressive win for the Pelicans, who are now 7-0 on the season. They will next face the Golden State Warriors in a showdown of two of the best teams in the NBA.

#  Pelicans make it seven in a row with latest victory!

NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Jrue Holiday scored 15 of his season-high 33 points in the fourth quarter and Anthony Davis had a huge night with 31 points and 16 rebounds, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to their seventh consecutive victory, 118-107 over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.

Jameer Nelson added 14 points for the Pelicans, who were without injured starters DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) and Rajon Rondo (thumb). Holiday shot 13 of 21 overall, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range.

''It was Jrue's show,'' Davis said. ''He did it all.''

Holiday said he benefited from Davis drawing double teams.

''They were doubling A.D. a lot and that opened up a lot for me,'' Holiday said. ''That's something I've been working on, being able to knock down shots when they do that.''

Tobias Harris led Detroit with 27 points, Avery Bradley scored 20 and Andre Drummond had 19 points and 18 rebounds. The Pistons have lost four in a row.

Drummond made things difficult for Davis inside, but the Pelicans rookie kept attacking the rim and scored New Orleans' first six points in the fourth quarter to give his team a 94-89 lead. Nelson hit a floater to make it 96-89 and Holiday followed with consecutive 3s to make it 102-91 with 7:51 left.
