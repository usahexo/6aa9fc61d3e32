#  Here's where bingo originated, and how it spread around the world!

The origins of bingo are still a mystery to many, but it's a popular game that can be found in casinos and social clubs all over the world!

Bingo began in Italy in the 16th century, where it was known as 'Lotto'. It was a lottery game that was played by the nobility, and the first official record of it being played was in 1530.

In the early 1800s, bingo made its way to France. It was renamed 'Le loto', and the game became very popular among the lower classes. French soldiers even took the game with them to North Africa during World War II!

After World War II, bingo spread throughout Europe. It became especially popular in Germany, where it was known as 'Das Bingo'. In the 1950s, German television began airing bingo games as part of their programming!

Bingo eventually made its way to North America in the 1960s. It started out as a game that was played by seniors in church basements, but it soon became popular in casinos and other gambling venues. By the 1970s, bingo had become a mainstream gambling game!

Today, bingo is enjoyed by people all over the world. There are variations of the game that are popular in different countries, but the basic premise is always the same - match numbers on your card to those that are called out, and hope to get B-I-N-G-O!

Bingo is one of those games that has been around for centuries, but no one really knows who invented it. There are a few different stories out there, but we can’t say for sure which one is true. Let’s take a look at the different versions of the story and see what we can learn about this popular game!

The first version of the story credits the invention of bingo to an Italian monk named Father Paolo Bono. According to this story, Father Bono created bingo as a way to amuse his monastery friends. He would call out numbers and his friends would mark them off on their cards. This version of the story seems unlikely though, since bingo didn’t become popular in Italy until much later – in fact, it wasn’t even played in Italy until the 1930s!

Another version of the story claims that bingo was actually invented by Charles Fey – the man who also invented the first slot machine. According to this story, Fey created bingo as a way to entertain his fellow casino employees. He would call out numbers and they would mark them off on their cards. Like the other story, this version of the story is also unlikely – bingo wasn’t played in casinos until much later than Charles Fey invented it!

So who actually invented bingo? We may never know for sure, but it seems most likely that it was some combination of Father Bono and Charles Fey – two people who came up with similar ideas at around the same time.
