#  Marseille up to second with win over Nantes 

Dimitri Payet scored a magnificent free-kick as Marseille came from behind to beat Nantes 3-1 and move up to second in Ligue 1 on Sunday.

Wahbi Khazri gave Nantes the lead early on at the Stade Vélodrome, but Payet curled home a sensational set-piece before half-time.

Rudi Garcia’s side then doubled their lead through Morgan Sanson, before Nantes grabbed a late consolation goal through Kalifa Coulibaly.

The result means Marseille are now just two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, while Nantes remain in mid-table.

#  Monaco maintain lead at the top with victory over Bordeaux 

Leonardo Jardim’s Monaco remain at the top of Ligue 1 after a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Girondins de Bordeaux. The game was evenly contested in the first half, but Monaco took the lead moments into the second half when Radamel Falcao headed in Thomas Lemar’s cross. Bordeaux equalized soon after through Diego Rolan, but Fabinho scored what would prove to be the winner with a superb curling effort from outside the penalty area.

The result means that Monaco maintain their three-point lead over Paris Saint-Germain, while Bordeaux find themselves in ninth place. Jardim’s side have impressed this season with their free-flowing attacking football and impressive defensive record, and they will be looking to hold on to their lead and win their first league title since 2000.

Elsewhere in Ligue 1, there were wins for Nice, Lyon and Marseille. Nice continue their march up the table with a 3-0 win away to Dijon, while Lyon came from behind to beat Metz 3-1 thanks to goals from Nabil Fekir, Alexandre Lacazette and Maxwel Cornet. Marseille also had to come from behind to win, overturning a one-goal deficit against struggling Toulouse with second-half goals from Florian Thauvin and Dimitri Payet.

#  Neymar scores four as PSG hammer Lille 

Paris Saint-Germain reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 with a 7-1 demolition of fellow title challengers Lille at the Parc des Princes. 

Neymar led the way with four goals, while Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe both got on the scoresheet twice.

The home side started brightly and took the lead in the eighth minute as Neymar fired home after good work down the right from Angel Di Maria.

Lille drew level soon after through Nicolas Pépé, but PSG regained control of the game and took a 3-1 lead into halftime courtesy of Cavani’s header and Mbappe’s close-range finish. 

Neymar added two more goals after the break, and there was still time for Mbappe to score his second late on as PSG ran riot.

#  Cavani equals Zlatan's goal-scoring record as PSG move clear at the top 

Edinson Cavani equalized Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s record as the all-time top goalscorer for Paris Saint-Germain, as the reigning Ligue 1 champions moved four points clear of title rivals Monaco with a 5-0 win over bottom side Troyes on Sunday.

Ibrahimovic, who left PSG for Manchester United last summer, scored 386 goals in all competitions for the club in eight seasons. Cavani, who has been at PSG since 2013, took his tally to 388 with a first-half penalty and second-half strikes either side of goals from Angel Di Maria and Julian Draxler.

Thiago Silva headed in a fifth goal in stoppage time to complete the rout and cap an excellent team performance. “It’s always important to score goals and break records, but the most important thing is the victory and to be four points ahead of Monaco with a game in hand,” said Cavani.

The Uruguay striker was given a standing ovation by the Parc des Princes crowd when he was replaced by Christopher Nkunku with 10 minutes remaining. “It was very emotional for me. I want to thank the supporters for their encouragement throughout my career here at PSG,” added Cavani.

PSG are now unbeaten in their last 15 league games and have not conceded a goal in their last six outings. They will go into next weekend’s clash against Marseille at the Velodrome knowing that victory would clinch them their sixth Ligue 1 title in seven years.

#  Who will win this year's Ligue 1 title?

This year's Ligue 1 title is up for grabs, as no team has yet been able to pull ahead in the standings. Monaco, PSG and Marseille are all in contention, with each team having its own strengths and weaknesses.

Monaco enters the race as the defending champions. They have a strong team ethos and are led by talismanic striker Radamel Falcao. However, they have been struggling recently, losing 2 out of their last 3 games.

PSG is always a top contender. They have some of the best players in the world on their team, including Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. However, they have been inconsistent this season, winning some big games while also losing some relatively low-stakes fixtures.

Marseille is the dark horse of the race. They have had an up-and-down season but are currently on a good run of form. They also have one of the best strikers in Europe in Dimitri Payet. However, they may struggle against teams who can match them for firepower.

Based on these factors, it is difficult to predict who will win this year's Ligue 1 title. However, my money would be on PSG to come out on top in the end.
