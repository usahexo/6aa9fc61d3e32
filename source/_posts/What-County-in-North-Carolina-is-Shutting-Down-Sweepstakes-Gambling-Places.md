#  What County in North Carolina is Shutting Down Sweepstakes Gambling Places?

The North Carolina county of Iredell is shutting down sweepstakes gambling places, effective February 1st of this year. This decision came about as a result of House Bill 97, which was passed in the summer of 2017. This law prohibits the use of an electronic machine or device for sweepstakes purposes.

There are many places throughout Iredell County that offer sweepstakes gambling, and while some owners feel they are not doing anything wrong, the fact remains that this type of gambling is illegal in North Carolina. Sheriff Darren Campbell wants to make it perfectly clear that these places are in violation of the law, and they will be shutting down.

This move by the sheriff's office is expected to have a major impact on sweepstakes gambling in Iredell County. Not only are the places that offer these games illegal, but also the people who own and operate them. It is hoped that by putting an end to these operations, it will help to reduce crime in the area.

Gambling has always been a controversial topic, and there are those who feel that it should be strictly regulated, if not outlawed altogether. While there may be some good that comes from gambling - such as providing jobs and generating tax revenue - there is no doubt that it can also have negative consequences, including addiction and crime.

It will be interesting to see how this new law plays out in Iredell County, and whether or not other counties in North Carolina follow suit. There is a good chance that this could be the beginning of a movement to crackdown on illegal gambling throughout the state.

#  NC County Closes All Sweepstakes Gambling Places

After a lengthy investigation, officials in North Carolina’s Currituck County have decided to close down all sweepstakes gambling places in the area. The move comes after authorities confiscated dozens of machines from various locations across the county.

According to Sheriff Susan Johnson, the decision was made after officials found that most of the businesses were breaking state law. “It’s become quite clear that these sweepstakes gambling places are nothing more than illegal casinos, and we’re not going to stand for it,” she said in a statement.

At least four sweepstakes gambling businesses were closed as a result of the sheriff’s investigation. It’s unclear whether any further action will be taken against other businesses in the area.

This is just the latest development in the ongoing battle between state and local governments over sweepstakes gambling. In recent months, several other counties across North Carolina have followed suit and closed down similar businesses.

Despite the closures, however, it appears that sweepstakes gambling is still alive and well in many parts of the state. Earlier this year, lawmakers unsuccessfully tried to pass a bill that would have regulated the industry statewide.

#  Wake County, NC to Close all Sweepstakes Gambling Places

After a unanimous vote by the Wake County Commissioners, all sweepstakes gambling places will be closed down in the county. This decision comes after much debate regarding the legality of these establishments and their impact on the community.

Sweepstakes gambling places are commonly known as “Internet cafes” and are currently spread throughout North Carolina. They offer customers the opportunity to gamble on electronic games in exchange for cash. The industry has been estimated to be worth $1 billion, but it has also been linked to various criminal activities, such as money laundering and human trafficking.

In making the decision to close these businesses, Wake County joins other counties in North Carolina that have already taken similar action. Alamance, Davidson, Forsyth, Guilford, Mecklenburg, Rowan, and Union counties have all closed down at least some of their sweepstakes gambling places.

Several state lawmakers have also attempted to pass legislation that would regulate and legalize these businesses, but those efforts have failed so far. In February 2018, a bill that would have allowed Internet cafes to remain open if they paid a $5,000 license fee was defeated in the state House of Representatives.

Some proponents of sweepstakes gambling argue that the businesses provide much-needed jobs and generate revenue for local governments. Others maintain that they are nothing more than illegal casinos and should be shut down. In Wake County, it appears that the commissioners have sided with the latter view.

#  Cumberland County, NC Shuts Down all Sweepstakes Gambling Places

The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office shuttered all sweepstakes gambling places in the county on Thursday, issuing cease and desist orders to the businesses.

"These businesses are not operating legally," Sheriff Earl "Moose" Butler said in a statement. "Our residents have made it clear that they do not want these establishments in our community and we are going to do everything we can to ensure they are not here."

The sheriff's office said it had received numerous complaints from residents about the operations of the sweepstakes gambling places, which often use computer terminals to simulate slot machines or video poker games.

The North Carolina General Assembly outlawed sweepstakes gambling in 2005, but the businesses have proliferated in recent years due to a legal loophole that allows them to operate if they give out free products or services.

Butler said his office was working with state and local officials to close that loophole and put an end to the sweepstakes gambling businesses.

#  Moore County, NC to Close All Sweepstakes Gambling Establishments

Moore County, North Carolina officials recently voted to close all sweepstakes gambling establishments in the county. The unanimous decision came after a 3-month long investigation that found the businesses were illegal and posed a public safety threat.

The vote closes all nine of the county's sweepstakes gambling establishments, including four that were already closed by state law enforcement officials in October. Operators of the businesses could face misdemeanor charges, and customers could be fined up to $500.

Moore County Sheriff Lane Carter says the investigation found that many of the customers at the gambling establishments were suffering from addiction problems. He also said that he received numerous complaints from businesses in the area about crime being committed by people coming from the gambling establishments.

Carter added that he believes the decision will help improve the quality of life for Moore County residents. "I'm just glad we can clean this up and make our community safer," he said.
