The home side took the lead in the 22nd minute as Messi curled a superb shot into the top corner from just outside the penalty area.

#  0-0: The result that leaves Barcelona top of La Liga on goal difference 

Barcelona hosted Valencia at the Nou Camp on Saturday knowing that a win would see them leapfrog Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Ernesto Valverde’s side controlled proceedings for large periods but found themselves frustrated by some inspired goalkeeping from Neto in the Valencia goal.

Lionel Messi was lively throughout and had the best chance of the first half when he rattled the post with a curling shot from just outside the area. The second half continued in much the same vein, with Barcelona camped in Valencia’s half but unable to find a way through.

With seven minutes remaining, Clement Lenglet headed home from a corner to give Barcelona the lead and three points which sees them move one point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. 

#  1-0: Barcelona survive late scare to maintain unbeaten streak 

Barcelona travelled to Girona on Tuesday night knowing that a win would see them maintain their unbeaten start to the season. Ernesto Valverde’s side took an early lead when Lionel Messi converted from the penalty spot, but Girona hit back with an equaliser just before halftime.

The second half was a much more even affair, with both sides creating chances, but it was ultimately Barcelona who claimed all three points thanks to an injury time winner from substitute Philippe Coutinho. The result means that Barcelona remain unbeaten after 12 games and maintain their six-point lead at the top of La Liga. 

#  Barcelona lead Real Madrid by just a point as Diego López denies Blancos at the death 

In a spectacular end to the match at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid were denied a victory by Diego López as Barcelona held on to their one-point lead in the race for the La Liga title. 

With just minutes of normal time remaining, Cristiano Ronaldo looked to have given Madrid all three points after his effort was adjudged to have crossed the line by assistant referee María José Rojas. But replays showed that the ball had not crossed over and it looked as if Los Blancos would have to settle for a draw. 

That was until López made an incredible save in stoppage time to deny James Rodríguez and keep Barcelona ahead on goal difference. Neymar had given Barcelona the lead early in the second half but Gareth Bale equalized for Madrid soon after. The result means that Barcelona are still top of La Liga, but their advantage is now just a single point over their fierce rivals.

#  How the results of Matchday 14 left Barcelona and Real Madrid in the La Liga title race

The actions of Matchday 14 in the Spanish La Liga left Barcelona and Real Madrid in a neck-and-neck race for the title.

Fc Barcelona, who hosted Valencia at the Nou Camp, kicked off proceedings with a convincing 5-1 victory. Lionel Messi was in fine form, netting a hat-trick and contributing an assist. Luis Suarez also got on the scoresheet, to round off an excellent team performance from Ernesto Valverde’s side.

Elsewhere, Los Blancos travelled to the Mestalla to take on Levante. Los Che had been in good form leading up to the match and took an early lead through Roger Marti. However, Real Madrid came back strongly in the second half, with goals from Marcelo, Casemiro and Toni Kroos securing all three points for Santiago Solari’s men.

This means that as things stand both sides are level on points at the top of the table, though Barcelona have a game in hand. The next Clasico, which will be played at the Santiago Bernabeu on March 3rd, is already looking like it could be a title decider.
